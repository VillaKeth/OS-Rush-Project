This file contains my Rapid Unix SHell (RUSH) project for Operating Systems. This program runs a shell terminal similar 
to the one that runs on Linux operating systems, and is capable of running built-in commands, external commands,
redirection, and parallel commands. Similar to the Linux terminal, a variable amount of whitespaces can be placed
between every command and argument, and if an invalid command occurs, the user will be notified, and the command
will not be run. Successfully executed commands will do as they would in a normal shell terminal.
